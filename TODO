Add multiple survey support
new column in users table, update test.sql
config.php - new array keys = survey name, values = image directory
admin page for switching surveys into global and ensuring proper db setup
start.php - submission of new user needs to include survey (if blank, pop first, but how do I get the key of it?) array_pop(array_keys(array))
